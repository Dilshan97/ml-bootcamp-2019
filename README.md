# ML Bootcamp 2019

You can find the resources, notes and links that will be used at the Machine Learning Bootcamp here.

## Day 1
* Intro to ML
* Problem framing
* Data preparation and Feature Engineering
* Linear and Logistic regression with scikit learn (theory + hands on)
* Intro to Tensorflow (sessions, graphs and basic principles + hands on)
